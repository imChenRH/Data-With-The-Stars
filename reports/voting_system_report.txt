NEW VOTING SYSTEM DESIGN & ANALYSIS REPORT
Dancing with the Stars - MCM 2026 Problem C
============================================================

1. VOTING SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------

Rank-Based Method (rank)
  Description: Each component contributes equally via ranks
  Seasons Used: 1-2, 28-34

Percentage-Based Method (percentage)
  Description: Components combined as percentages of totals
  Seasons Used: 3-27

Weighted Percentage Method (weighted_percentage)
  Description: Judges weighted more heavily to ensure skill recognition
  Seasons Used: Proposed

Dynamic Weight Method (dynamic_weight)
  Description: Weights change based on score variance
  Seasons Used: Proposed

Hybrid Elimination Method (hybrid_elimination)
  Description: Bottom 3 identified, judges vote on elimination
  Seasons Used: Proposed

Cumulative Score Method (cumulative)
  Description: Historical performance affects current weight
  Seasons Used: Proposed

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------

    Based on our analysis, we recommend the following:
    
    FOR FAIRNESS (ensuring skilled dancers advance):
    - Weighted Percentage Method with 60% judge weight
    - Or Hybrid Elimination Method with bottom-3 selection
    
    FOR EXCITEMENT (maintaining fan engagement):
    - Dynamic Weight Method that adjusts based on score variance
    - This rewards skill when differences are clear,
      but allows fan preference when performances are close
    
    FOR CONTROVERSY PREVENTION:
    - Hybrid Elimination provides a safety net
    - Prevents extremely unpopular eliminations while
      still giving fans significant influence
    
    OPTIMAL COMBINATION:
    We propose a tiered system:
    1. Use Dynamic Weight Method for preliminary ranking
    2. Apply Hybrid Elimination for bottom-3 decision
    3. Consider Cumulative Method for later stages to
       protect consistently good performers
